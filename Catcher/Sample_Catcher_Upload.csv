The business session followed. A nominating committee was appointed, Mrs. E.M. Kearney, Mrs. Richards and Mrs. William Hamilton. Miss Jennie Bailey gave a report of the County Convention, giving some of the amusing side lights of the meeting. One of the interesting features of the July meeting is the pinning on of the white ribbon bow on the new members which was done by Mrs. Mary Hess. The program was put on by the members from Westfield and proved to be a very delightful and entertaining one. Two fine musical selections wer egiven, Alyce Pearce with violin, and Beulah Brown with flute, accompanied by Miss Lelah Brown at the piano. 
Elizabeth Lord gave a reading, ""Saved by a Boy"" which showed the influence of a six year old boy on a man's life. Alyce Pearce gave a humorous reading, ""A Trip to the Dentist."" The play ""Sewing for the Heathen"" was well carried out in a natural and very pleasing way. the characters were well represented, and provided an hour of much enjoyment to the appreciative audience. the need of sewing for the Heathen at home, as well as in Africa was shown.
This July meeting is in the nature of a vacation from our regular work, and adds a touch of humor, which is a stimulus to more active work. Thanks are due our Westfield members, and we hope they will come again. A social hour followed and fine lunch served, the cool spacious porch provided a comfortable place. Miss Elizabeth Burnside of Oskaloosa was an out of town guest.

Little Louise Cook sang two solos in a chamingly innocent manner. Anna May Schooley and Cecelia Simcox sang two greatly appreciated duets. Dancing was the subject of the meeting. Mrs. J.S. Stoaks had charge of the program. The round dance wa sset in the brothels of Greece. the painted cheeks and present styl of scanty dress originated in the brothels of Paris. Shall we follow the customs that originated in the brothels? Dancing is mentioned 36 times in the Bible, but it was never men and women dancing together. The church and the home should be the centers of high ideals and good influences. Does dancing develope the good and best things in the dancers? Would not time be spent better on other things than dancing? Dancing which begins in the home and slect club often ends in public dance. It is a harmful amusement which becomes a dissipation."

Their laws are modelled after the laws of New York and in many cases are exact copies. so that I feel more at home than in Illinois, though before I left Peoria I had become better acquainted with their laws than many of their old lawyers. Burlington which is twenty miles from here is the temporary seat of Government it contains about 800 inhabitants, this place is 20 miles north of the mouth of the Des Moines and contains about 400 inhabitants. 12 miles below here is fort Des Moines where there are two companies of dragoons stationed. Blackhawk has a [illegible] or cabin about six miles south. There is no more danger to be apprehended from Indians than there is from the Dutch in Columbia Co. In beauty of situation Fort Madison will compare with any place I have seen in the far west except Peoria. it has the advantage over Peoria in the broad Mississippi and is I should think a healthier location. the character of the population is not of that lawless character which is imagined at the east. & for what I can at present see there is as much morality & honesty among the settlers as in the same number of persons in New York. many of the emigrants are from New York & the Eastern States [illegible] bring with them their manners habits & customs. the coming of spring & summer will add greatly to the population in this region. it is now estimated at 10000 west of the river & in 1832 there was scarcely a white man between the [illegible] & the Des Moines. the Winter has been unusually cold but the river is now breaking up & steamboats are expected in the course of a week. last year there were fifteen steam boats engaged in the trade on the Upper Mississippi. it is said there will be more this year. I am glad to hear that Edward will weather the Storm of the [Money?] [illegible]. I had a good many fears on his account. it gives me much pleasure to hear William is doing so well. but much more to learn from your letter that you continue to enjoy comparatively good health. I shall look with a great deal of interest for your next letter & nothing would gratify me more than to obtain your views upon the subject you mentioned. a subject which I have thought much about for several years. I am in good health well pleased with my boarding house and pass my time as pleasantly as I ever did. always finding something to do or busying myself with my books.

It is most awful cold here now the thermometer has not been above 20º to day and was 28º below this morning with the wind blowing hard it comes hard being about the first cold weather we have had. I dont mind it much as I am dressed warmer than any winter before I thought if I was obliged to spend the winter in this climate I would try and keep warm if clothes
pioneers,2787,fula,would do it. While I am writing Hattie is trying to find you some cards for your picture book I should judge from the stack she is putting aside that you will get quite an addition to your stock of pictures. Hattie has her book most done. I am very glad you like your book I like it splendid the first time reading one is apt to become so interested in the story that they loose many of the beautiful thoughts expressed it is a good book to read aloud the last time I read it was at Alden last spring My cousin from N.Y. and
pioneers,2788,fula,and I was out to an uncles in the country a few days and it was so cold we had to stay in the house so we read Lucile aloud she thought it was immence. I was some afraid you might have it. I have my broom hung up very conspcous every body admires it and I am afraid I will ware my coat out I brush it so much that would be too bad wouldnt it. I hope you will be able to get those photos taken soon. I want to see you so bad or your

Now about mine I am going to get as soon as that mustache gets a little more visable I am realy quite proud when I think how well I will look when it gets it ""work in"" a little better at present I have very little to say but if this cold snap does not use the young and tender thing up entirely I think in about six weeks more I will be able to send you a picture of as fine an article in the way of a mustache as any of the eastern boys can produce. So my dear girl try and be patient remember it takes a good deal of patience"

I guess though for that matter Aunt Myra has her share too. No we had heard nothing of it till your letter. You must try and get in all the news for your letters are all the means we have now of keeping posted. I cant write to them all and Hattie finds it very hard to write so the consequence is that all the news we get you write. I hope little Bessie wont have a very
pioneers,2793,fula,hard time with her fever. If they have it east no harder than it has been here this fall and winter there wont be much danger but she will come out all right. But it is a terrible disease at first and I cant blame any one for worrying. So Coz Min. you realy do get a little blue and anxious if you dont here from the west at the appointed time Well coz I can only say that I am gratified to think that my letters do afford you to some degree the same pleasure that yours do me So you think Min that I dont know you very well Now I will bet you that I do.

I am very sorry I assure you to be obliged to disappoint you again on my picture I meant as much as could be to get it taken so as to send it this time but was too busy to get it taken at the time I had set for having it done but I can promise you the picture of that mustache next time I write you for sure. So cousin Min you will let me off this time wont you?"
pioneers,2796,fula,In the mean time you see I will have time to apply more cream and coax my mustache along a little better. Now Minnie in regard to your mailing my letters as much as I like  to get them at the appointed time I can see that it must be difficult to get them to the office always just as you would like to and I will always make an allowance on that account If I get them in time I shall answer Sunday and if not I will answer as soon as I can after I do get them. I am very sorry Cousin if I hurt your feelings in what I said last time. I certainly did
pioneers,2797,fula,"not in tend to of course I know you like to hear from me but what I meant had reference to the future cant you see that you may become so situated that our correspondence would be inconvenient to you or there might be some young man in the scrape and it would not be just the thing for a a ""cousin"" like me to be quite so ""sweet"" on you. Excuse me for talking quite so plain but I dont wish to be miss under stood.

Labor is honorable and it makes more of a man or woman of one to have to depend on their own labor in some degree. Any way Coz you have my sympathy I know all this must make you feel very bad and blue but look on the bright side it will come out all

I feel sorry for her she does get awful lonesome this winter weather not being able to go much of any place and our neighborhood has changed so in a year that there is hardly any body to run in and I am obliged to be at the store most all the time so she

It always seemed to me as though that those who have brothers and sisters never half appreciated the fact they cant realize what it would be to be the only one of a family. I suppose you know that I did have a sister but she died when I was ten years old so I never fully appreciated her. I often

drewelowe,2458,,How the quarter did notreach very far I retain now no memory
drewelowe,2471,,"When the first Colony ends it's way, there are smiles that make us happy."
drewelowe,4575,,"Upon the day designated for the sword swallowing act I had no food as usual upon such an occasion. St. Mary's must make a sizable profit off of its medical patients - the stomach aches - for they are forever going without meals. At such at time - under a decided nervous strain - I am apprehensive, exceedingly restless and talkative. As usual too, I was sent down to the Colonial Hospital soon after the lunch hour - and as customarily, I had to sit and lie and bite my fingernails for an interval that seemed hours before they were ready for one in the operating room.
This is my fourth gastroscopy - was bad enough the second worst I have ever known. However, it didn't begin to compare to the one that had gone before by some two weeks. This difference is easily explainable by our improved condition of the mucous membrane of the stomach. The doctors upon gastroscopic examination remarked that the membrane was healing nicely, ""there was remarkable improvement"" and ""it doesn't look like the same stomach."" The erosions and ulcerations of two weeks back had disappeared, I was told; however I still had a bad case of [cartarchal?] gastritis - a kind that is hard to heal and responds much more slowly to treatment than ulcers. Consequently towing the mucous membrane is an impossible task.
As it happened, I wasn't dismissed nor was I sent home. No one said anything farther about throwing me out. After the ordeal of the gastroscopy, the subject of my leaving was not again broached and seemed to have become one of the"
drewelowe,4574,,"I had fully expected to complete the series of lavages before the next gastroscopy. The doctor had staken a march on me - as they are want to do sometimes when things (meaning tests and operations) come hard and perhaps sometimes for to. Being somewhat prepared for the blow - I thought - which was to fall somewhat later however did not prevent me from blanching every which way or from becoming paralyzed with mortal fear when the announcement came. I doubt, however, that gastroscopies can ever be taken with equanimity.
All the more - and it usually happens to be a high percentage of men - who take gastroscopies dread them horribly. They think this is the world's worst test and express themselves freely from this point. They are not for wrong. Of course I can think of any member of more pleasant things to do - but it is just one of those things that cannot be avoided much as one could do without the ghastly business.
Upon entering the hospital, indeed the gastroscopy that threw me - the one responsible for consigning me to the hospital - was a ""humdinger."" The local condition of the old craw made of it an especially terrifying experience. It was impossible to get the instruments all the way down at that time. Moreover every movement of the instruments would stir up the contractions of the muscles anew and the reflexes would clamp down. It was a dread event. After that most painful experience I moderately became intimidated and afraid of those that had to follow."
drewelowe,4573,,"By this time the medical men I am sure - were a little contrite too. It was arranged that I have the gastroscopy of Monday - Dr Marusch's day on duty at the Colonial operating room. Thus the days business for any room was concluded, but there were other matters requiring the attention of the physicians.
""We might as well sit right here and dispose of these problems too since this is the most pleasant place we have been today."" In just a few moments time one of the fellows brought in a report from upstairs. Dr Rivers studied it intently, then he beamed ""Go and take his pants away. he isn't ready and can't leave yet"" and turning to me, explained -
""Occasionally, it is necessary here, to grab someone's pants away from him and detain him a little longer.""
I had not been altogether unprepared for the scheduling of the oncoming gastroscopy for it had only been a few days previous that i had commented apprehensively to the doctors one morning.
""I suppose that when I am through with the lavages, I shall have to have another gastroscopy, shall I not?""
""Yes, that is right,"" the answer uncommitingly.
""I was sure of it. I was certain we should need some check to determine the progress I am making. We need to know, don't we?""
Yes you are quite right,"" uninformitively, but adequate to prove my fears were not groundless."
drewelowe,4572,,"No one had said a single word to me about leaving here game; not one single word of reproach did I hear from anyone; no one scholded me: I could feel disapproved, however, and that the doctors were provoked with me. Perhaps my conscience hurt me one infinitesimal bit by this time as it should have. Perhaps I should have felt better had I been severely reprimanded. I remember that morning so well. Dr Lucien Smith sat in the doctor's chair at my bedside facing in; Dr Reecer disposed of himself on the edge of the now empty companion bed across the room; Dr Rivers was in a rocking chair at the fast end. From the physician's chair Dr Smith opened the conversation with the remark, ""Mrs Van Ek has now has had six lavages. Let's see.' Suppose we send her down for gastroscopy tomorrow on Monday - which ever day Dr Marsch is at the Colonial - and then send her home?"" I gasped and perceptably blanched. I had been spanked and I know it! Dr Rivers from the fast end of the bed contributed something ""Undoubtedly that would be a good idea.""
By this time I had recovered my speech and mental alertness sufficiently to note, ""You sound exactly as though you have been praciticing your speeches in the hall."" Dr. Smith instantaneously with a nimbleness of wit and very fittingly responded ""Oh sure, we have been rehearsing."" And I know that they had.
The tension meanwhile had lessened. Everyone heaved a big silent sigh, relaxed and was himself."
drewelowe,4571,,"was sitting on the edge of the bed with my overnight case on my knees, paging hastily through its contents when Sister Rebecca came in as she always seemed to do whenever anything unusual was transpiring. Concernedly but not too surprisedly or unkindly she demanded to know, ""Why Mrs Van Ek, what are you doing?""
""I can't find my socks,"" I made answer perturbedly, and continued my digging.
The hose finally having been brought to light, Eve determinedly concluded her dressing - shoes, coat and for a change even a hat was donned while Sister stood helplessly by. The presence of a hat might indicate my thoroughly agitated state of mind.
I then drank my half and half, grabbed my medicine and determinedly walked from the hospital. I breathed deeply of the invigorating air; breathed freely, drank deeply of the eased tension and felt liberated. Then I took a bus to the village, bought some nail polish, some vitamins and medicines, a radio to Montgomery Ward and waited wearily at the Kahler drug store for a bus back to St. Mary's. In slightly more than an hour I was back in room 242, tucked into bed; tired but freed from tension; my nerves quieted and cooled off; catching up on my regulation milk and medication schedule.
The following morning when the doctors filed into the room there was an unused tension"
drewelowe,4570,,"a typical woman of her generation.
All that day before she was to go up to surgery, all evening long and the following morning our room was crowded with would-be cheerful realities. As usual the boy came about 3:30 to take me up to the laboratory for my lavage. An hour or two later upon my return I was surprised to find her still there. The sons and daughters were still dutifully hanging on. From the doctors examination, I sensed from the beginning that her case was hopeless. However, when I found the good woman still lying in 242; still waiting to go up to surgery at that time of day I know my diagnosis was correct. I was convinced that her sand of time was ebbing out. The minutes dragged by but it was not until after my lunch hour, close onto one o'clock that the nurse took her away in a wheel chair. She was a good scout. She went bravely; bless her soul.
I was more distraught by those events than I had any right to be. Somehow I know she was beyond human help. Moreover I was tired - worn out by too much stress and strain nervous. I realized I must relax and rest but my nerves wouldn't permit me to. The hospital was unbearale; the room was unbearable. I felt I could scream and would if I didn't get out. I could stay in no longer but needed to get away from it all.
Driven by the desperate need to ease the tension I did out of bed, got into my clothes and"
drewelowe,4569,,"patient or patients that were thrown together. Usually they were careful about not getting too ulcer patients in the same room - doctors orders - but beyond that usually no slightest consideration was shown for anyone, it seemed. Perhaps I am unfair; however, I think not.
The last of those six patients to go up to surgery by way of my room was a grim old Welsh lady, well up in the seventies. After she had been admitted, Dr Reecer - who was conducting the examination - unable to adjust the bed lamp properly, somewhat clumsily but unintentionally broke it. Sometime later, Sister Rebecca - the floor supervisor - upon her tour of inspection found it dangling by one hook. A bit provokedly she enquired somewhat sharply ""What on earth did leap  pow to the bedlamp?""
""One of the doctors is responsible,"" she quietly, composedly replied, ""Dr Reecer - I think it was he who books it.""
""What did he do that for?"" snapped Sister Rebecca arrangedly as she swept out with the lamp to have it repaired.
After Sister Becky had gone I interestedly rebooked the aged Wilkommen, ""Now why did you have to tell her that it was Dr Reecer who broke the lamp?"" Why did you not simply say as I would have, had I been in your place, that you didn't know what had happened. You know Dr Reeser is a nice fellow and he didn't willfully break the thing. Why did you have to expose him?""
""But that would be telling a lie"" insisted the woman of rigorous background, forthright training-"
drewelowe,4568,,"In medical at St. Mary's, as I initiated before, the few small singles at what would be reasonable prices for habitable rooms, are smal, dark, depressing. Moreover being adjacent to the kitchens they are disconcertingly noisy. The very few other singles are not in a professor's salary range - at least not a professor at the University of Colorado. I therefore had chosen to retain to my old double room at the end of the hall close removed from the hub, and took a chance on the inconvenience of a cell mate.
The first two weeks of hospitalization were unfortunate. Six surgical cases had come in and gone out of that room.The nervous strain was terrific. These cases were usually brought in one afternoon, prepared for surgery and taken to the seventh floor the following morning. Occasionally several days preparation are required. St. Mary's is one of the most mercenary institutions I have ever come in contact with. There were plenty of vacant rooms but there was no consideration shone for the type of"
drewelowe,4567,,"the tub consistently had to be scrubbed before we could draw the water. This is the community bath rooms. The rooms were furnished with antiquated wash towels and pitchers but no depository for waste water. As a patient I have had to take a bath without a towel and drip myself dry on a chill winter morning, despite ringing for some service which never came. Gospel truth! No wonder I had several small colds while hospitalized.
As usual, I was put upon a Sippy diet - that is four ounces of milk and cream every hour, with antacids and medications in between. My second morning I was wheelchaired to the laboratory on the fourth floor and began a series of eight lavages. Ordinarily I chose to walk when I was able, but I had to see whether the wheelchair rode like a rickashaw. It was not nearly so exciting!
We were taken to the laboratory without breakfast, lay on individual cots about the room and swallowed macaroni sized tubes. The technician drained first the gastric juices poured in weak solution of silver-nitrate into the stomach through the tube, rotated me a certain number of minutes then pumped and syphoned the solutions out. This was followed by a saline wash which again was syphoned out. The technician was very careful to get the stomach free from waste in each instance. The technicians - I may add - are always proficient."
drewelowe,4566,,We usually scorned those preferring the general utility laundry tub in the bath
drewelowe,4565,,"entirely wasted.
Second-center Medical, before the addition of the new wing, were the quarters in the very very old hospital assigned to stomach-aches primarily. These victims, if they so much as expressed a food dislike, to say nothing of an idiosyncrasy within their dietary requirements, had these disliked substances shoved at him almost exclusively and nothing else time after time. It is a mistake - I must reiterate - to voice any opinion on foods, especially if you can't lathe a certain substance for that is the one thing you got forever and ever. Amen!
Second-center Medical was also characterized as the old wing at St. Mary's where - in the good old days - it was even impossible to attain a clean bedspread by begging on bended knees. I remember I used to have to resort to all sorts of ruses to get cleaned up for Christmas and Thanksgiving and New Year's. The favorite was way to ""get"" watercolors all over the bedspread - and then of course a new one would have to be granted, despite floor supervisors. Medical patients never had enough linens, nor were there enough towels on two racks most of the time. So very, very frequently we had to ring for a diminutive turkish towel before a bath. Moreover"
drewelowe,4563,,"Since of apparently was showing improvement and was being helped the physicians suggested a prolonged stay on the same terms. But needless to say, I was getting rested. Never in my life had I been so constant and content in one spot, but I felt I should be getting back to Rochester and then finally have her come back and pick me up. About this time I was anxious to get back to Colorado and home.
After three weeks of quiet unbroken rest I again reported to the Clinic for farther help and council. I was rechecked and observed for another ten days or two weeks. I was ready to be dismissed and Van came to drive me back home. And still retaining more pep and energy than I could summon later, we drove back to Colorado through the Black Hills. We had gone back and forth so often through Nebraska that we thought this might be a delectable change despite a longer road. The journey was a bit tedious but interesting and we enjoyed the new country through which we passed. Much of it, of course, was mountainous and drab and lost and dusty but the Nettles and the Black Hills of South Dakota added much to our geographical knowledge of America and our pleasure in the trip. Moreover it was not so strenuous because we took it by easy laps.
Nov 1939
Having an unfortunate unhappy faculty to always be in some kind of difficulty I returned to the Clinic for a fourth session the following year. By Thanksgiving in Nov 1939 I found myself once more consigned to St. Mary's. It being once more the"
drewelowe,4564,,"holiday season the same old room and the same old bed were awaiting A Number One, guinea-pig. I went conditionally - or so I though tat least. I had informed the doctors that they might admit me and I would go providing no ""funny stuff would be pulled."" Moreover, i told them, I would tolerate no food tests, no tricks! With that understanding then I went to St. Mary's a second time.
The approach to my being interred in the hospital upon this occasion was quite a contrast to that of ten years back. Not only did I define my expectations as to treatment, but the nurses also upon my entry repeated the commands of the physicians. They insisted hospital rules be obeyed. I get disrobed and hop into bed. ""Furthermore"" - it was especially emphasized, ""You are not to leave the hospital without permission."" The idea of leaving had not occured to me before, but now a suggestion lodged in my mind and developed maturity later.
After the routine checking in I was tucked snugly into my bed and awaited house doctors to conduct their examinations. And now I not only was a patient but what was more important, I knew how to depart myself as a normal patient should. The six weeks of apprenticeship, two years before, had not been"
drewelowe,4562,,"whatsoever to do with the decision for I had not even been consulted. The doctors unbeknowingly to me had mapped out my program for me. One morning when I arrived at the Clinic for consultation and direction everything had been arranged. Everything was in readiness except getting my ticket for me.
The doctors knowing that I had relatives in general, and a sister who is a nurse specifically, Waverly- near Minneapolis had decided that i was to go then for a few weeks. it was suggested that I was to go to my sisters for bed rest after which I was again to return to Rochester & the Clinic for another going over. Indeed I was being packed off that very afternoon.
I took the afternoon bus to Minneapolis since that gave me the best connections in the shortest possible time to Waverly. it must have been between six and seven - as I recall - when I reached Waverly. Bob met me in her glope and transferred me to her home. Then I was off to bed on the usual much modified ambulatory with the usual medications - antacids, alkalies, sedatives - plus a new pink anti-spasmodic pill which I was trying out. Everytime I sat feet to the floor I was upbraided and then back into bed. Finally wishing at my sisters to avoid reproaches I meekly obeyed. For three weeks I stayed on my regiment of bedtime rest and began to mark some progress. however I did fall before the accustomed violent attack of July hay fever. The pollen that downs me then seems to thrive in the grain belt season, although it is by no means isolated to that regions during the harvest season. There was one swell attack that levelled me too in the Ukraine in Russia - a head on collission that sent me sprawling."
drewelowe,4561,,"The pink pill - I am convinced - did something for me. It seemed for a time to disconnect something perhaps the nervous system from the stomach. For a time the doubling up was intercepted and didn't seem to follow the self-same old groove, but had broken down and disintegrated its established walls. later - about Christmas time it began to react queerly. Then I was prostrated for days with a terrific migraine, which set the clamps on my head hard, and excited a mighty force. Quickly enough the anti-spasmodics were disontinued."
drewelowe,4560,,"I think - that I would this easily develop bad incorrigible habits, I was that, that amused!
""Yes, but Dr Alvarez,"" I protested, ""I am not getting a thrill out of these tablets as you suppose, but they are actually intensifying the pain."" Opiates just don't take with me.
In order to be sure that we were right I offered, ""Dr. Alvarez, if it would be any help to you I would be willing to do another day or his without fading."" It was then that he told me the story about the man who was conditioning his house to live on nothing. ""And you will probably be like the horse,"" he said, ""about the time we got you conditioned to live on nothing you will up and die on us.""
After all these days trying out various food substances and failing to get relief, it was proved by and a doubt that we should have to look elsewhere for causes of dishes. Food was not the only disturbing factor that had to be considered. Unfortunately we were unable to beget a miracle, and I have had to go our as best I could with careful helps from the medical men. Despite direction and sign board it has been an alone road, and uphill all the way.
On foods, we had ended up in the customary manner in the usual blind alley. Where to go on from there? That was the all important position. How to proceed. I had nothing."
drewelowe,4558,,[blank page]
drewelowe,4557,,"me for breakfast. It was the last straw. With reason I was deeply incensed. I pushed the repulsive dish away with distaste and disgust.
""Fried potatoes? I can't eat that stuff and they know it,"" I said you have a baked potato for me?"" With that I went to the dietitian in the auto-room in tears of frustration.
""You are supposed to have a baked potato for me. There is none. I can't eat those fried ones,"" and I dissolved in weeping.
""Don't get all upset. You will have to eat something otherwise you will be all nervous and worn out. You are all nervous now.""
""You would be too,"" I told her, ""if you had a stomachache all night and then have fried potatoes shoved at you for breakfast, when you could eat little of any thing.""
""I am sorry that is all we have for you but we can have a baked potato for you at eleven, if you care to come back then.""
""I will be back,"" I replied and I was.
One noon I went into the diet kitchen for my potato. There was even some lemon jello for me which looked inviting and appetizing. In excellent spirits I chatted with the waitress and asked for seconds even before I had begun the firsts. Halfway through then original helping however, the pylons got the jump on me. I telescoped. Sat with my load in"
drewelowe,4556,,"The following day I was quite apologetic but he seemed to think nothing of having been disturbed by me. I also told him of the nightmare and said I didn't think I should take any more of the capsules. ""No you shouldn't take any more of them""
""Well, then what shall I do with them, throw them away?""
""Oh no, bring them back and we shall try them on someone else.""
There had been days on beans. There were days on potatoes. Potatoes and more potatoes. Hot potatoes in the diet kitchen; cold potatotes to pack along for mid-meal snacks and at night to relieve distress and keep something in the stomach. A hot baked or a freshly boiled potato in its jacket in acceptable at any time, providing it is served with plenty of butter; but a cold potato, well, it can never be anything but a cold potato! In the diet kitchen one fine morning I was dished up a whole plateful of fried potatoes, swimming in grease. Now fried potatoes are marvellous for certain people at certain times but for me... Tricks! Tricks again! Tricks just to observe action and reaction.
I was hungry. I had moreover had distress most of the night - and then to have a heap of fried potatoes shoved at"
drewelowe,4555,,"of distress. One such might greatly disturbed because I had vomited a bit of blood. I rang for the house nurse. She came but she knew so little to do. She however, quieted and back to bed thinking perhaps after all my imagination had deluded me. It is highly improbably that it did for I have extraordinarily good vision and lucid imagery. It never has been known to play tricks on me. I wish I might say as much for any other mental processes.
Another day; another test. This time Dr Alvarez gave me some capsules to try out. I was to take one at bedtime. Then he went on to tell me exactly how the capsule contents had been designed. It isn't a pretty story and I can't recall the exact words but in substance it went something like this. A cat had been crazed by teasing. In the course of crazing, I understand, some portion of the poor animals brain was effected. Then a combination of substances or drugs had been devised to disconnect that part of the brain so effected. Thus the animal had again been restored to sanity.
I took the capsules thinking no more of it, with my other indications and bedtime feeding. However the gruesome story of the poor each pushed itself forward and my compassion got the better of me. How cruelly the poor animal had been tortured. The story stalked me into sleep. Finally, however, I was off to dream - laid only to awaken with ghastly pain, form a hideous nightmare of 12:30 am or 1:00am. I never have nitemares, I was terrified! In my disturbed state of mind. I called Clinic emergency and the night operator got Dr Alvarez on the wire. He was very kind and told me what to do and take but I was quite perturbed to have resorted to disturbing his night's rest. He was very nice about it."
drewelowe,4554,,"supervision for a year and a half - but rather an arrangement to simplify the food that I was taking so much that it would be possible to determine whether it was food that was worrying my stomach into illness; or whether there were other factors involved. Theoretically speaking, if it were food alone that was being responsible for the condition of my stomach then I should be completely distress free after several days on agreeable food. That is what we were all hoping for. Dr Alvarez had had some miraculous responses in some of his patients.
So under Dr Alvarez's tutelage, I went from one food to another, each in turn for a number of days, and then at length to none at all. Right now, I am a bit confused about which came first and why but am able to remember and relate to the general idea. We tried among others a diet composed largely of a species of bean - grown in southern Europe and Mexico I believe. In Italy, Spain, and Mexico it is used sometimes as a food for infants. This small bean when cooked was hardly larger than a pea and was completely bland after the cellophane shell was removed. There was little also to occupy me at these meals, so I sat at length and pulled the little kernels out of the skins one by one in order to get some food.
Sometimes at night I was terror stricken. In my room at the Kahler, because it was summer and warm I slept with the windows ajar and the shades flung up to let in the air. Disregarding these curtained windows I usually slept with my lights on most of the night as I drifted in and out of oblivion; in and out"
drewelowe,4553,,"disprove the test, I had a bit of peanut butter and what do you think? I got hives, of course!
""I am not at all sure,"" was his measured reply, ""that something rubbed into the skin reacts in the same manner as something rubbed into the tummy.""
Those weeks at the Clinic I apparently was given so slight and casual attention outside of consultation and appointments, I soon perceived or felt rather that I was under close observation. Not only in the diet kitchen were actions and reactions noted but also elsewhere in the waiting rooms, offices; - where not? Embarrassingly enough I was doubling up all over the place. The pylons used so little judgment in its timing and the selection of an opportune environment. I felt I was reported to my physicians by desk attendants, diet kitchen waitresses and dietitians and staff.
One afternoon, while I was waiting in Dr Alvarez's office I sank over on the davenport, my head on both my own arm and that of davenport, when he shot in. I uprighted my self, tears pushing from my eyes. I couldn't help myself from showing distress, ""Dr Alvarez,"" I gasped, ""something awful is putting the thumbscrews onto my stomach."" He therefore reached into his packet and pulled out a packet of malted milk tablets that he carried for just such emergencies."" ""Here,"" he recommended kindly, ""take some of these. They sometimes help me."" I gratefully took a number and the pain fled. Surprisedly I said, smiling, ""Why, Dr Alvarez, I am feeling better now.""
The problem then was not so much an elimination diet - I had done that under medical"
drewelowe,4552,,"daily consultations. And again, I was given one set of food tests - these common foods, except for the pork and the peanuts which might have been included among the others to serve as a check. They could have. Interestingly enough, they were the only substances that came out negatively. These, of course, had not been on my diet sheet for a matter of ten - no - fifteen years. Therefore it was to be expected that I might be desensitized to them.
The other foods, however, caused a furor. I reacted beautifully - much more than I had even one and one-half years before. I did so well by them that my thigh was swollen into one big lump. It was impossible to read those others and differentiate between them because the had all become engulfed in the mountainous mass. In order to check the peanuts, and peanut butter being mechanically a non-irritant, I tried a diminutive quantity one morning. The result - hives. We dared not try the pork because of digestive reasons both mechanical and chemical.
All this was interesting and - I thought - amusing despite my periodic discomfort. So I said to Dr Rivers one morning ""Do you want to know something funny?""
Yes, surely - what is it?""
""You know the food tests, I have been subjected to? Well, of all the substances tested peanuts and pork were the only ones that came out negatively. I should not be sensitive to them because I have had none of either in many years. However, just to prove or"
drewelowe,4551,,"the instruments were turned; more gazing more comment, ""Let's have another look at this place!"" The instruments were tripped out a little and bit by bit the stomach interior was combed. ""This is the most spasmodic stomach I have ever seen.""
After what seemed an interminable time, I was boosted upright and supported as the instruments were withdrawn. This blindfold was removed and I dazedly sat up. My dripping eyes and nose and mouth were wiped. The assistant took me back into the afternoon where I was permitted to lie down a long time to cool off. When I felt able I slipped quietly away and Van who was faithfully waiting in the lobby drove me back to my room.
There was some chance the doctors thought that I might get to go back to Clorods with the Dean after I had completed the examination.So Van waited around for me in the hope that I should be able to drive back with him. But alas! it was decreed otherwise. It had been decided that Dr Alvarez was to take one in hand once more and try to determine what was worrying the stomach and try moreover to get the food-stomach straightened out. The Dean then had to drive back down two days later than he had expected to and after registration, to teach not the second summer session at the University.
Dr Alvarez meanwhile put me back into the diet kitchen for a number of weeks and watched over me as a mother hen does over its chick. There were"
drewelowe,4550,,"arranged on it, left shoulder in exact position, my back twisted alongside a support, on left hip with knees flexed to relax abdominal tension. Now that the table was set I was blindfolded; the instruments were shoved down my throat to the waistline; the gun roared and we were off. I felt as though I had swallowed an extensive cast-iron pipe length, my upper body was that inflexible and immovable. No wonder for there must be a direct line of vision from the mouth opening to the entrails. Of course the light in the room was blotted out so the stomach beam would shine all the more brightly by contrast.
Dr. Moersch encouraged ""Steady now."" ""You are doing fine."" We are getting a fine view ""That's a good girl."" The nurse with mouth on my right ear kept whispering sweet nothings, ""Now breathe through your mouth Mrs. Van Ek."" ""don't breathe so hard"" ""Take it easy"" ""Breath  Mrs Van Ek."" ""That's fine."" ""You are doing fine."" ""Breathe, Mrs. Van Ek"" we will soon be ""through""
Meanwhile the doctors in turn peered into the stomach; they commented; the instruments were turned. ""Now what is this that we have here."" Dr. Moersch pointed out, ""See on the lesser curvature. The blood vessels are near the surface. There is some erosion. The mucous membrane is there."" Again"
drewelowe,4549,,"as best I could to the small curious sway-backed chair, so constructed as to make the most of on'es arched back and throat. The assistant sat on a slant at a higher level facing me. Only his eyes were visible. He gripped my tongue with one hand, with the other he jabbed and pried the swab again and again deeply into my throat until it was quite deadened.
I then was asked to move to the three-legged stool beside the table and the two assistants worked on my arm to give me an intraven injection. As they buried themselves I announced, ""Before execution a prisoner is always granted a last request. I have two such requests - the one, after you get the instruments down take all the time you need to do a good job; the other, after the gastroscopy is over might I please have plenty of gauses to mop up.""
This done I was told to get upon the table. of course I very happily complied. The table in this case closely resembles an ironing board as to general shape mounting and construction. Even its appearance as to covering is crown boardish. My head was turned towards the larger end; my feet stretched rambled off somewhere in the tapering direction. A short rubber hose was forced down my throat. Many hands held me to the table - a large lump - as it was tilted head end down. My stomach, thus upside down, was drained. by Newtons law of gravity. The table sprang back into place. I was systematically"
drewelowe,4548,,"let go. As I sat up for the technician to withdraw the tube I perceived a trace of blood in the test tube but I said nothing. This was my first intimation of what was wrong and why the pain was so severe. Up to that time even my usual curiosity lay buried beneath having to endure. I was interested in nothing else, which demonstrates - I think - how debilitated the organism had become.
It was noon. The Clinic was deserted. I was transferred to the small waiting cubical, and together with a number of freshly dressed pillows was deposited upon the davenport. However, I still retained my head standing position for some time before the stomach relaxed, and before the Dean - who was waiting in the car - could take me back to my room to rest out the day.
The stomach and duodenal x-rays but divulged nothing but I had hemorrhaged in the Histamine. This necessitated more complete information; scrutiny of the stomach first hand; in fact a gastroscopy. With this event on the calender, I was sent to the gastroscopic section to consult Dr. Mausch. He gave me an appointment for the morrow.
At the time indicated I presented myself at the desk of the Colonial Hospital, submitted my card and paid the spiraling room fee. Then I was sent to the sixth floor and waited on the cot in the small restroom until the doctors were ready for me. All in due time I was conducted to the operating-room where the Ku Klux Klaners - in white robes and white masks were gathered. The first of these - an assisting doctor, thoroughly [cocained?] my throat in preparation as I fitted myself my curves"
drewelowe,4547,,"shall have to call your doctor before we can go on."" With that she entered the adjoining laboratory and called Dr. Rivers extension, and right away his assistant Dr Phillips was in the room. He checked me and asked whether I should be able to go on with the test. Knowing full well that if it were not completed then and I should have to began completely anew I elected to continue and have it over with. Procrastination or waiting would make Histamine no easier. I much preferred to finish the Histamine then, then to have to go through the period of preparation again - the apprehension fit; the inconvenience and discomfort of the starvation period; the fuss and bother of taking the tube; plus using another day. So the test went on at great effort and agony. When it had began, I was lying on my back with flexed knees, almost two hours later when it ended I was in what I call my head standing position. This is sort of a tripod position with the top of the head and the knees forming the tripod. Only in this the knees are drawn close to the head, and the body is halved somewhere in between. I also call this contortion pain because spasmodic pain has a tendency to draw the body into a ball encircling the stomach. This - I think - helps to relax the muscles and untighten the reflexes.
As all things pass away, this test also was finally concluded, but I was still caught in acute pyloric-spasm which clamped down with a deadly intent and wouldn't"
drewelowe,4546,,"import out to know in the control of symptoms. I always thought the Histamine was one of the worst tasks a human being was unfortunate enough to come up against. At that time I dreaded it more than a gastroscopy, perhaps because it is so long drawn out. The ill effects from a gastroscopy are of short duration. If not the worst test neither is it my favorite attendant. At the appointed hour I approached the young lady at the proper desk on the first floor of the Clinic. She took my card and me into the slender waiting room where I awaited my name to be called. The technician very shortly called my name and took me into her private-ward, made me comfortable in the cot and slipped the tube down my throat. Of course I had had no food or drink that morning. Test tubes were placed on the table and then followed the histamine injection. Immediately i was engulfed in heat; the blood plunged to my head and it began to pound unmercifully, violently. The technician dipped compresses in cold water and lay them upon my forehead. She began to syphon after ten or fifteen minutes. Whereupon the muscles of the stomach began contraction and the pylorus clamped down. I doubled up with pain.
In the midst of syphoning the first test tube the technician stayed the procedure with the remark ""This probably explains a lot of your trouble and pain. We"
drewelowe,4545,,"July 1938
About the middle of July after vacationing in the Trapper Lake region of Colorado on the western slope and in the Telons, the Dean drove me back to Rochester in Kippy Toe for a check. (Kippy Toe our time honored and revered Dodge - well named, I think meaning hot or boiling water in Russian. Kippy Toe always lives up to her name never failing to boil on the pull up a mountain slope).
The first day or two I cleared, - with good grace -, the routine hoops: - blood counts and tests; long x-rays; general examination - The next two days the not so often rolled routine hoops - a gall bladder dge test; stomach and duodenal x-rays, with equally good grace. On the [illegible], I fell headlong; the gastroscopy stubbed my toe, each with bad grace.
By this time - my third appearance at the Clinic - I had graduated from the soup course, the water and cookies of a test meal; to a dessert course - a histamine without the soup. The histamine is so called after the drag which is used to provoke the hydrocloric acid secretion. The test makes it possible to measure the secretion of the acid glands in the stomach and determine the amount of free hydrocloric acid. During a period of activation of ulcer symptoms, acid steps up. It is important to the physician to know how much, for from it he can determine how active the ulcer. It is also"
drewelowe,4544,,"into a snail effect. Flexed knee supported her chest; scrawny arms turned around stalk-like legs. A then whisp of chinese-silk nightgown encased the immobile statue and protected it but flimsily against the coldly ventilated wintery room. She had a gastritis - In kind resulting from inadequate eating habits which permitted the stomach to shrink and lose its flexibility, and therefore had to be expanded at great discomfort. In addition to a gastritis, this woman had an extraordinary constipation curse. One evening Dr. Sam - one of the fellows - with a wicked gleam in his eye announced to her, ""If I were able to string your entrails around the floor, and kick them around a bit, you would be all right. You would be constipation free.""
We shrieked with glee and delight.
After six weeks at St. Mary's I was dismissed on new Year's eve to spend a few weeks at my sister's in northern Minnesota with the understanding that I was to report back at the Clinic for another check before I could be permitted to get my final dismissal."
drewelowe,4543,,"Finally, however, I became aware that she was putting on a show for her parents. The doctors were nice to her all the while. Moreover, she seemed to be howling for hypodermics most of the time, and howled after she got them.
On Sunday afternoon the climax came. My nerves definitely edged, could endure the strain no longer.  After her parents left I told her I should have to ask the doctors to be moved in the morning. I left my bed, went to the small lecture room but a few doors down the corridor and lay down on the davenport. The nurses meanwhile quieted the girl and put me back to bed. The following morning I was sent to the Clinic neither early for a whole series of stomach and digestive x-rays. The opportunity of my absence was taken by the physicians to have us both moved, without even a by our leave. The girl was transposed to a small dingy single down the hall; I found my personal effects in the comfortable big double next door - just freshly housecleaned it was and inviting. I had this room all to myself during the holidays and needless to say I was grateful for the peace and solitude.
Later when the crowd again began to gather - as they will in Rochester as quickly as the holidays are out of the way - Second-center Medical began to seethe. It didn't take long to fill up the old wing and I again found myself with a roommate sharing 242. This person - a sliver of an old maid - mouselike in manner and appearance was not at all disturbing. She talked little. it was she who sat up in bed to sleep most of the night - not upright as you or I sit, but rather more curled."
drewelowe,4542,,"She wept copiously. She ailed. She whined about having a ""major operation"" in June for the same thing, and was now about to undergo a repetition. Puzzled, I asked her.
""Yes, but the surgeon didn't make an incision in June, did he?""
No, but it was a major operation and now I almost have another for the same thing - and only five months later.""
""If there was no incision you had no major operation,"" I correct her, ""and this is going to be nothing for you to be afraid of."" Fortunately for my peace of mind this woman was taken away the following morning and went to surgery still whining.
A second howler came in with a case of pneumonia. She - a young girl very much spoiled. Her record: - She had been [bodied] through a lot of illness  including a good deal of hospital nursing and care. The home - a small village - not many miles away made her accessible to her family. Every afternoon a matronly woman - her mother - came to sit with her and worry over her. Her father, [human?], was only able to visit when his shop - a meat market was closed upon Sundays or holidays.
By mornings, - this girl in her bed in her corner of the room, and I, in my bed in my corner diagonally across the room - would laugh and joke. She apparently was getting along very well - Every afternoon, however, when her folks arrived she quite convincingly stayed her howling act. I was fooled at first and felt sorry for the girl for I believed she really was ill."
drewelowe,4541,,"Nombutal capsules he had bargained for an obtained at bedtime. He slept. He slept so well in fact that it was almost impossible to arouse him for his breakfast in the morning.
As every where else in every walk of life, hospitals too have their quotas and more of whiners. Whailers are trying anywhere but among other patients who have their own trouble and are trying to stand up under them, they can be demoralizing and are despicable. The patient who has courage and can take it without a whimper - and does - is the one who rightly receives the ovations. He is the one to be commended.
One such was a woman from Washington State who was my roommate just enough to be prepared for surgery. She - it was - who really taught me the meaning of courage. This lady from Seattle - a decidedly not well to do person - came on to Rochester from her home all alone, knowing she was to have a colostomy, a very messy sort of operation. It really requires two rather major operations following rather closely upon each other. Not once did the express one word of fear, or despair, or complaint. She went upstairs smiling bravely and cheerfully and went through the ordeal all by herself. She comes out of surgery wan and thin but still with a broad smile - an example truly to be cited for courage.
A middle-aged local woman of forty-five or fifty exemplified the other extreme the whiner. This woman came in to have a polyp scrapped from the uterus, a comparatively simple process, I am told. She carried on continuously."
drewelowe,4540,,"contact, but as they really are. Under trying circumstances individuals they show their natural stripe. No wonder the physicians are so facil at knowing and so adept of learning people. Medical men have no patience with faked illnesses, and spend no time or energy on these imaginary ills. I have seen the dockers but sensed make-believers have it straight from the shoulder. Such lectures! The advise given couldn't help but penetrate the dullest skulls; the thickets skins. Lectures that could not readily be forgotten. After one such I remarked to one of the doctors, ""No one would ever dare to talk to me that way."" - the way I have heard them talk to a roommate, to a man down the hall, to a youth in the ward. The tactics was unquestionably direct but it is not always so. In the food tests - we remember - methods are more subtle, depending, of course, upon the ease and the result desired.
Patients, as I have observed them, are an extraordinarily strange bunch of people. None more so! - excepting myself, of course. Stomach-achers are even more curious than most of the others.
There was the one, at least - the Mexican bull-fighter - he was known to have slept soundly at St. Mary's. Stomach patients - intense, nervous type, ordinarily but not always get [Nembuctol?] (a sedative) at bedtime to insure proper rest and relaxation. The bull-fighter was reported as having induced several other patients in the ward to trade their Nembutol. How he manipulated this we never quite learned - but the story a good one, I think, is not to be spoiled by idle speculation. The bull-fighter took these several"
drewelowe,4539,,"on my tray. The aspect of it looked somewhat fishy. Scrutinizing it suspiciously, I rang for a dietitian and asked whether the fish was fried.
""Of course not! That fish is baked"" was her unhesitant reply.
""I will take your word for it, however, it certainly looks fried to me. Are you sure it is baked?""
""Yes + quite. Ulcer patients fish is always baked,"" she repeated.
I thought no more of it until distress buckled me up, clamped down, hung on - then, of course, I knew momentarily the fish was to blame. After a night of abdominal torture, not feeling too well, I was lying flat the next morning - something that didn't happen with me very often then. At the appearance of the physicians I cantankerously jumped upon them in one burst of words, ""Somebody lied to me,"" I complained. ""Somebody lied to me otherwise I wouldn't have eaten the fish, and I wouldn't be ill now. The dietitian told me especially the fish was baked. It wasn't baked! It was fried!""
""Jarrie you go to the kitchen and find out whether the fish was fried."" Dr Rivers commanded one of the fellows. Dr. Annis soon returned and announced that the kitchen had repeated the fish baked. ""However,"" I was told, ""the kitchen might have made a mistake in the trays."" I was unconvinced. I know exactly what had happened!
A hospital certainly gives one an opportunity to learn people - not in the usual superficial and artificial manner of social"
drewelowe,4538,,"And yet these men are not sadists - in fact they are far removed from those who would derive pleasure from putting us through the third degree. I have known them to flinch as much at my discomfort as I do. They have moreover been known to be very, very disturbed when they are unable to alleviate distress and have to return a verdict of hopelessness to a patient. They have to know what is wrong before they can prescribe to correct what is out of line. Doctors have to know! ++ I realize all too well that they can only help me by learning me - my idiosyncrasies; my stomach. Science needs evidence!
Another day the cream soup on my tray (half milk and half cream flavored with a vegetable) was flavored with spinach. This vegetable perhaps is the most deadly to me of any I can name. When I had entered the hospital I had told the dietitian I couldn't take spinach, consequently i was quite provoked to find spinach cream soup on my tray. I therefore, took the bowl of soup, jumped out of bed, ran to teh bathroom and dumped the contents. The following morning upon the daily round of the medicine man I informed them. ""A bowl of spinach soup was dished up on my tray yesterday noon. I dumped it into the sewer!"" All ears waited with unmistakable intentness for the answer as Dr Ravens inquired, ""Did you eat it? Did it make you ill?"" ""Oh no! I said I didn't eat it. I dumped it into the sewer!"" I repeated not without relish.
Later I was shoved up to an ambulatory ulcer diet. Upon Friday an inevitable helping of fish appeared"
drewelowe,4537,,"thoroughness and knowledge is what counts. They have both qualities in abundance.
These people, in their unlimited patience, have taken the trouble to learn me as no one else has ever taken the trouble. And because they have learned me and understand fully the stomach situation they are expending every energy, every scientific knowledge to help me get it righted. If unfortunately the going is a bit rough for me in the meantime, I cannot best believe. They know what they do. The methods I once accused as being medievally cruel and tortuous were so only because I am so highly sensitive. Others do not react so sharply or suffer as did I.
There was the one unforgettable day at St. Mary's when I found a few grains of pepper in the bottom of my glass of milk. The half and half it was, was tried so that it came late and was brought into my room when the doctors were in making their morning rounds. I grasped the glass in both hands - announced they might have it if I didn't need it so badly myself, drank deeply, toyed with it and drank, toyed and drank some more. It was only as I neared the bottom of the glass that I discovered the sediment. Unfinished I set the remainder of the milk on the bedside table, but I never have been certain whether a few minute particles get into my stomach or not. I shall never know whether my feelings were hurt more than my stomach but I felt I had been let down. This is the sort of program I would call constructively destructive - with the emphasis on destructive."
drewelowe,4535,,"they seem - for some undefinable reason - unable to adjust their knowledge to new circumstances. To me a one-track mind professes a pathetic inadequacy in ability, plus training, plus imagination, plus discernment, plus analyses. They perhaps have some slight inkling of the wood of which man is constructed; some idea of the physical differences and individual needs; but somehow lack initiative to apply learned sales + everyday life: I have yet to see a dietitian who can manipulate dietary knowledge to a new pattern. My respects to all of them with whom I have come in contact. One must be an original damn fool to be a dietitian!
Long before we had arrived at the comfortable understanding however, that I was to omit foods I couldn't take with impunity, there was a trying guinea-pig ere. I had warned again and again I would never return to St. Mary's I had registered an oath that I was through being experimented upon. Moreover I was strong to performing in order to substantiate put theories; Through being capitalized by the Mayo  Clinic just because my stomach happened to be the most sensitive in the world.
Nevertheless I have returned to the clinic and to ST. Mary's. Not once but often. I have returned to the clinic because there are no other doctors to turn to; no one else to help me. Not without reason have I such unfounded confidence in these men. I have observed them at work and know what they can do. I know how they exhaust every symptom every possible disorder and trace it to its very root. For thoroughness they have no peers - and"
drewelowe,4534,,"during the activation of symptoms, sweets never agree. I have seen a number of patients levelled by a simple corn-starch pudding - I doubt that it ever fails. Another favorite trick is to jump the patient without warning, or by promoting him by the usual easy stages from a first or second week. Sippy diet, to an ambulatory ulcer. That brings about decisive results if there is an ulcer (-as I understand it - . Then sure enough doubling up agents are all very well in determining ulcers but add to them others employed to find out the susceptibility of ""I am a stomach"" it is an endurance test of no small proportions. When the majority of foods are not innocuous, it means days and nights of unforgettable torture.
Since the doctors have discovered the tormenting reactions of this particular organism to many substances, no simple food is ever forced. In fact suggestions are quite contrary - I think - to that given to most individuals, ""Don't try to take anything you can't handle"" and ""Do the best you can about certain food conditions which are not disturbing to you."" indefinitely advised by different physicians. Irritations and discomfort has greatly added to my stomach problem and these factors - they feel - must be avoided if I am to escape from the difficulty.
Dietitians, however, are not very adept at making a distinction between an average and an exception of ease. I have never encountered one who was such a ""nature horse."" They seem to have acquired enough knowledge on a scientifically established diet with proper calories for the normal person. They seem however, to lack an ability to adapt this knowledge to fit other problems. Somehow"
drewelowe,4533,,"Dr. Alvarez had worked for weeks with me as an elimination diet and I responded the first thing by getting very ill on rice. Most everything bothered me and doubled me up time after time - and always we ended upon a blind alley. The stomach doctors admit that a reaction from a food test is not necessarily the same - the reaction to an intermuscular injection of a diminutive quantity of the substance in question - is that in the digestive process when a like substance may be rubbed into the gastric mucous membrane. Therefore sundry methods are employed to gain information in regard to an individual's food problem. There is no end to the trouble they take in an attempt to find a solution to your difficulties.
By having the patient partake of the food directly and thus testing it and noting reactions, physicians can more readily and reliably ascertain results. They can then know whether there is an idiosyncrasy or whether there is a clinical bain or a mechanical reason for disagreement, or merely a patient's dislike for a certain food or a perversity upon an individual's post. In general people aren't merely as allergic as they individually would have us believe they are. Doctors contend that the average allergic case is better off on a liberal diet with possibly but a few exceptions.
Physicians are also able to determine to some degree just short of positive proof the presence of ulcer. Will the presence of a higher hydrocloric acid content in the stomach"
drewelowe,4532,,"In Second Center Medical at St. Mary's tests of all kinds are common affairs and observers are sheep-eyed. In fact surveillance is not relaxed for one minute, one might almost say by day or by night. As a patient I know that not only pulses, temperature, anything pertaining to the physical body was recorded, but every act of mine, every reaction, every stomachache, was likewise watched; every mouthful of food was noted as also that which was rejected. The physicians, figuratively speaking, all but came around with stovewood are hard to enforce hospital discipline from me. To be sure these netted results. My stomach truly made the progress on a strict ulcer regimen; not only in regard to food, but also in the deciphering of my person in establishing habits of rest so essential to stomach improvement.
It is quite unwise to ever let a dietitian know the foods you are unable to eat, for these are noted particularly, - and then that is all you get. These substances are stored out of one in many different forms and disguises. No conscientious physician is going to take your food idiosyncrasies for granted. It is his business to check; observe for himself and make his own deduction.
Food tests are perfunctory. I had been all through all those a year before and had reacted beautifully to almost everything."
drewelowe,4531,,"sensitive - keenly perceiving; keenly analytical; keenly penetrating and quick minded. They know people and are not much fooled by them.
Doctors in the sole factors, upon occasion, almost convincingly pretend to ignore any thing the patient may have to say. A patient is not only not supposed to know nothing about himself, nothing. Not even his symptoms are taken too seriously until they have been proved or disproved by observation and test: Nothing is taken for granted. And yet - despite feigned indifference - physicians are shrewdly aware of the patients' opinion; sharply discerning to any thing that occur.
Physicians so often loathe pertinent questions in banter. In medicine - surgery especially - joking covers a deadly serious business. The more serious a situation may be, the more it is concealed; the more nonchalant, more unconcerned they would appear. However, they are not always able to fool everyone. despite their would be indifference tell-tale give-aways creep into their act. Sometimes this is displayed in a compelling note, an urgent eagerness in questions; sometimes an irrelevant query pops from nowhere into the report or the exchange of friendly conversation. It is almost possible to hear the ""pricking up of ears"" and the abating of breath in the attentive attitudes a patient may surprise in his doctors. The patient is not the only one who may occasionally be then off guard."
drewelowe,4530,,"becomes so obvious, so curiously simplified with knowledge. Mysteries that seemed so baffling upon erstwhile observation often becomes closely discernable to a finely perceptive mind. Oftentimes too the problem may become more and more complex in the same light of greater knowledge, and farther and farther removed from a reasonable solution. This is my type of stomach. It defies explanation.
Even now the search continues. Ideas need to be modified and reconstructed; improvement is striven for; new approaches are sought. Conditions of an organism change. It must either show progress and improvement or else retrogression will landslide what already has been accomplished and won at a price. The quest for truth is an unending one. The rest is on the march and not even the end of life itself shall punctuate the final sentence and add the final period.
Doctors are a great bunch of actors; they are great pretenders. They also rate among the finest psychologists in the world. The research man is just as much a dreamer as I am. Moreover they are opportunists and eagerly make the most of unusual features in a case, and for an act of the ordinary case, [that shoppers?] to be left on their doorstep there is no limit to their patience and interest - it is six hours stable. The very best physicians know medicine inside and out and an ever alertly curious and attentive to all phases and application of the science. Furthermore the finest of them are extraordinarily ""thin-skinned"" and"
drewelowe,4529,,"a matter of matching exact edges and then checking the whole for accuracy of design. Truly the pattern of the puzzle is made legible, until minute bits sit together in mosaic fashion assume formidable proportions.
Imagination applied to matters of personal welfare is not conducive to serenity and composure. It can have thoroughly destructive respects. Therefore I would reiterate it is so much better to know the truth, be it ever so terrifying, of all the facts based on reason. It is better to face these severely and make the necessary adjustments, rather than sidestep acceptance and permit the mind to dwell on outlets to imaginary ills.
(No II) Although there may be an uncomfortable interlude between thinking and knowing - a reasoning human being is bound to find out what is going on. He cannot be helped in complete ignorance indefinitely. We are all in agreement, that the imagination - alive and busy as it is - if given a free reign, will not neglect its opportunities. Facts then intercept untimely interests of imagination.
There can be no certainty to an individual as long as he is lost in a flooding snowstorm; or he is groping his way through a thick clinging curtain of joy. As soon as the mental haze begins to lift, however, and a beam of light penetrates the blur, he is able to distinguish comforting landmarks his peace of mind returns. Only then are we able to relate facts and differentiate between them. Strangely enough the pattern of textures"
drewelowe,4528,,"unrelated and widely scattered which left huge gaps in the information, imagination - of course - supplied the substance of the novels, but not in a manner conducive to a piece of mind.
The uncertainty of not knowing all the related facts of a case is extremely disconcerting. If there are a number of tricks established beyond a doubt, but there is no substantiating evidence to stop the gaps in the chain, how else are the voids to be filled? Naturally the imagination will busy itself and sometimes supply likely ideas and even more frequently perhaps highly improbably answers. The mind of ""I am a Stomach"" is a restless part of a restless individual and toys with possibilities and gyrates with solutions to the unknown. The whole gamut of the imaginably true will line up and force recognition upon the mind. Theoretically some of the suppositions are perfect, but practically, they cannot be made to fit the knowns, nor can they endure checking. Then they must - of course - be discarded for other ideas which may be equally false.
It is only after each possibility however infinitesimal or remote it may have seemed at the beginning, has been closely scrutinized and weighed accordingly and found adequate that it may be added to the partially completed puzzle. Even some such additions may later be found wanting and must be discarded despite their apparently perfect fit. Thus the design is evolved and traced step by step. It is completed by a process of consideration and reasoning"

Despite future to detect an ulcer when the storm broke - the storm build of innumberable squalls throughout the years of my existence - I am a contingent throughout the years of my existence - I am a contingent hemorrhagic case. Some of the thunderheads that had amassed - the smokescreens - have been dispelled with a greater food knowledge and applicatory relative personal antipathies; medicines, and above all rest. What he's below, however, is still shrouded in semi-fog. Whatever the trouble the type of treatment beneficial to the one will help all complexities, interdigested as they are.
The tests employed to determine the difficulties of Second-center Medical patients - as I intimated before - mere fantastic in the exhema. They couldn't have been devised by personalities devoid of imagination. It wasn't reasonable that they could be secured as they did. For a number of days, my disbelief was so challenged that I began to think my own faculties had become untrustworthy; that I was truly losing my mind, that I was developing a persecution complex.
Fortunately for me however I could follow the steps the doctors took - and did with great glee, avidly and interest. The understanding the why of it all, the perspective righted itself of its own accord. In the meantime, however, my mind was in a maze of incredulity and not knowing.
From the first there were certain obvious facts but there were also those lesser ones apparently"
drewelowe,4526,,"""pill-taster"" and ""try-outer"" of the Clinic - not a bed capacity really if the reactions weren't so immense. If the new medicines agreed with me, it seemed they were ready for general consumption; if not, then they had to be thrown away or tried on someone else. I however, was the last word, the highest authority.
The most important element in my case, however, was never the absence or the presence of order. It was not even essential to treatment. For there was that other thing that I had been struggling with, that other thing so much bigger, so much more involved, so much more complicated and overpowering. That which embraces more minor ailments and drowns them out by sheer torture. What a blessed relief to have had only one small ulcer rather than the gastric-neurosthenia which clamped down and fastened the torture of the demand on me. Not only has it physically rocked my body with pain; but what is worse, has cruelly tormented me mentally with doubt and fear and wondering.
When I first went to the Clinic for help, I was all too aware of the fact that I had been skating along and whirling about on a very, very thin shell of ice. The very flimsy, not even I had the slightest suspicion. A mere film - it turned out to be - that would bear no more than feather weight. A caressing breeze passing by and touching ever so faintly the gossamer surface might have shattered the"
drewelowe,4525,,"To me it has always seemed logical to think that the reason for any bodily illness or disturbance be determined before it can be corrected or removed in order to reach the health objective. Since, however, causes and effects in this complex case such almost impossible to ascertain completely; since the causes for my strange stomach behavior were not to be isolated and destroyed, my relief had to come otherwise. The long round-about way has had to be pursued for the lone organism - a tedious road of trial and error. No one, however, has ever said die, and we continue to try and try. Somehow I don't make sense, but eventually results must come.
Repeated x-rays of the stomach and duodenum had failed to locate an ulcer. Yet an ulcer couldn't be positively ruled out. X-rays are only about ninety-five percent perfect and admittedly are not foolproof. The gastroscope does not reach the posterior wall of the duodenum. In order to establish clinically then, the presence of ulcer it was necessary to perform certain tests - and these, I will always [illegible], bespeak of medical torture.
The things that transpired at Stroud-center Medical at St. Mary's were absolutely incredible. Too true, I was the favored guinea-pig. Never having had a one like me before it was necessary to test, to experiment, to sort out facts, to reject materials. That was the only approach to a difficult problem and the only way in which I could be helped. What worked like magic for the average of ten proved disasterous for me! Why? Can anyone ever really know. So I became the official"
drewelowe,4524,,"The following morning I was breathing deeply before the widly flying window with its crush of brisk, invigorating Minnesota winter rushing into the room, when the doctors descended upon me in their daily tour of inspection. They however, never caught me in bed until a few days later, on Thanksgiving morning to be exact, after an exceptionally bad night of food-demons and distress. Feeling none too well I had thrown myself, fully dressed to complete to high heels and all, face down on the whitely-smooth bed with feet dangling over the foot board.
""How are you?"" I was questioned.
""I am fine, thank you!""
""Why do you lie on your stomach? Do you feel better that way?"" gently interrogated Dr. Rivers.
""Oh no - but - "" and I pulled myself into an upright position proped against the head of the bed. The grumpy feeling must have been perceptible for the great Rivers firmly but kindly suggested to me before the doctors deposited, ""I think it would be well for you to hop into bed and stay there!"" And thus I so neatly was tucked beneath the covers. Even after the fellows, coming down the hall if they so much as caught me out of bed sang out with an emphatic snapping of fingers. ""Jump into bed. Doctors orders."" By this time I was accustomed to following instructions, my resistance was threadbare, and I was only too willing to settle down to rest. I was mortally weary. So, so weary!"
drewelowe,4523,,"out of sorts, disgruntled, woe begone! nauseated. ""If I have to stay in this place can't that thing be hung away out of sight?"" I demanded. ""Oh I am so sorry. Surely it can be put away,"" replied the little corpulent lady in such apologetic voice. I was heartily ashamed of my early morning display of ill temper.
My blood pressure was taken. I put down into my robe over my ship and was in front of the mirror arranging my coiffeur where a voice boomed through the room, ""She is here, but she isn't in yet,"" and Dr. Rivers with his coterie at Mr D's - House doctors, fellows, visiting physicians, odds and ends, and the staff nurse - burst into the room and draped itself over the chairs and empty bed edges in order to survey the situation.
True enough - I was there, but I wasn't in bed. it was quite a number of days before they managed to get me into bed by slow degrees - before I realized what the bed was for. No one forced me. I was gradually acclimated, and gradually accustomed to the idea. The psychology of these doctors was superb. 
The second morning the doctors found me all dressed up in pajamas before my improvised easel - in an old-time rocking chair in front of the tall broad windows. The bedside table was rigged up and tabled to the proper angle and made an excellent easel. There I was playing my trade to be sure. Watercolor! How exciting!
""Now what have we here?"" they demanded to know."
drewelowe,4522,,"Mar 1937
After the regular routine and general examinations the x-rays and the gastroscopy had been completed and the diagnosis clicked. Dr. Rivers gave me an admission card to St Mary's Hospital on Thursday afternoon with the statement, ""I will see you at St. Mary's in the morning."" Normal man reported right away when he was sent to the hospital, but I had some shopping to do and my snacking in preparation for incarceration. Then too I reasoned, I would get there bright and early in the morning before the doctors appeared - and sleeping would perhaps be much more comfortable and vastly cheaper where I was.
So I arose early, breakfasted, pulled myself together and taxied to St. Mary's, the day still comfortably young for a hospital. The place looked especially uninviting in early morning disarray - the old ring which was second-center Medical for so long. On this particular morning it looked especially unusually dark and dismal and old. The gloom was depressing. As usual, too beds were at a premium, the place was crowded, but I finally managed to find an [illegible]-bed in a double room with a diabetic. There was no single room! Diabetics usually are chose and this roommate was no exception. Her arms were festoons of fab from shoulder to elbow, from elbow to wrist - a series of loops + fingertips.

""If it were possible to change the fine sensitivities for a more comfortable make-up, implying by comfortable - dull-witted, you would be free from allergies. It is your artistic temperament that makes you what you are and we would not change that. You are the people who make the world go around.""
""Moreover,"" he said, ""you must absolutely realize your boundaries and confine yourself to them - stop before a crash and go to bed periodically to store up another amount of energy and reserve to draw upon.

lie all over the streets, eat out of house doors or stand in your way chewing their ""cud"". They seem quite sleak and fat in contrast with the people and other animals - everyone and everything seems to be underfed. The monkeys run all over building roofs, hang from towers and trees like giant hairy worms clinging to the boughs. Out in the country the trees are alive with leaping apes. The ""monkey Temple"" in Benares is infested with the dirty things - they are pests because they eat all the fruit from trees. We also saw three or four wedding pro-cessions in Jaipur. There are only two or three marriage dayse so we were fortunate. The processions are made up of elephants, horses, people etc. The groom, dressed mostly in gold cloth (made from real gold thread) rides in state upon an elephant, horse or in a baby carriage (?). The elephant is dresed in rich brocades and his ears and head pained becomingly in intricate designs. Sometimes the bridegroom is heralded by the band - a noisy affair of queer instrument; and if he is wealthy his procession contains two dancing girls who sing and dance ""on the street corner"" (if there were one) The groom may be three years or he may be eighteen or nineteen as the case may be. The bride doesn't figure much in an Indian wedding procession, but the following day she joined the procession and rode in a closed carriage. Some of the indian women walk under a curtain and have only peepholes to look out from. This sort of a garment adds mystery"
drewelowe,5552,,"and interest to the male, I suppose rather than detract as it is supposed to do. Others who show their face, wear lovely graceful costumes - they are draped around the waist across the front from left to right shoulder and then over the head. The men wear ugly turbans and a swathing about the thighs called ""sarees"". We took several carriage drives. The coachman and guide sat high up in front; Van and I together with the servant sat low in the middle the two seats facing each other; and a page stood on behind. This all sounds very romantic put if you could only see us in actual life. The driver wore a dirty turban wadded about his head, and trailing along in the breeze; the guide, and old decrepit man, a little round hat and his shirt-tail hanging below his coat; our boy an 1800 model coat with a ruffle of shirttail protruding all the way around. Its all very funny and reminded me of the cinderella story and the pumkin and mouse carriage which was turned into a carriage of state for the princess. When we get home the princess (I) will return to her cinderella state, and the be-servanted carriage will turn back into a pumpkin and mouse affair. The general condition of the people of India in extreme poverty. They live in inbelievable filthy an tiny holes in the walls and their clothes are very often in tatters. Most of northern India seems dry and parched and desolate - even the land seems tired and worn out. We are feeling better here than we did in the tropics - but soon we shall be again where it is so hot and humid. This climate is much as it is at home early October - dry and the sun warm and bright. We must still be careful of the sun"
drewelowe,5550,,"The second most interesting place was Benares. I wrote Esther about that so I won't repeat here but the river scenes on the Sacred Ganges were most fascinating. The place which stands out with equal atmosphere and local color as Benares, is ""the pink city"" Jaipur a wholly native sate. A Maharaja owns and governs this vast estate, but everything he does must be approved by a British advisor. This Jaipur is so native that they use local postagestamps - really rather interesting. The Maharaja's palace, his stables of 300 horses, 50 elephants and innummerable camels was quite worth while. The present Maharaja is [1q?] years old but has only one wife. When he attains his 21st birthday he shall take unto himself another two wives. We are told by the natives that the late Maharaja (before this) had four wives and 1500 concubines and 60 children. If you would see his establishment, a labyrinth of rooms and apartments, you would believe this could be so. Then we visited the abandoned city of [Arube?] where we took the elephant ride to and fro. He, the elephant, kneeled for us to climb up the ladder to his back there he raised himself upon his front legs and last upon his hand. When he walked we lurched backward and forward, every step a lunge - but he did walk oh, so slowly but rather footsure. The city of amber, is built in a lovely hilly spot with a high wall all around. The palace stands almost as it was left, pink walls splotched, and greyed and weathered with time, but many of the other buildings have fallen wholly in ruins. It is really a very picturesque spot. In Jaipur millions of doves flock about the city - you really never saw so many. Pigeons, peacocks, bulls and monkeys are sacred - they run all over the place without any discrepancy of time or place. [Idoly?] bulls"

Dearest Mother, Well here we are off the beaten track again in a native villiage - more native than india it seems to me, although from across the river, many smokestacks are to be seen. 
We came here just to see Mr. Gaudi, a political leader of the  day and one of the outstanding indians. We went to see his school today and also had a visit with him. This is all part of Van's program but tonight we move on to Bombay. You really don't know how glad we shall be when we finally leave India. This country is especially hard to travel in. We have to travel with a servant who is our valet, servant, shoe-shiner, flunky or whatever you care to call him. Furthermore we have to take our bedding through India, because this is not provided for upon trains. of course all this adds to the expense and the inconvenience of travel, and besides every place you go a lot of hangerson line up for tips. These local parasites are an abomination and spoil all the fun if there would ever be any. They don't do a thing for you, but they expect a lot for nothing, - a little coin isn't acceptable, so these moochers get mad and throw it back in your face. They are unpleasant lot. A lot had happened since I last wrote you from Calcutta and Esther from Agra or Benares, Of course Agra was the high light of India - with its famous Taj Mahal, the most beautiful building in the world. It is a mausoleum built by the Emperor Shaw Jehav for his favorite queen about three hundred years ago. It is built on gigantic proportions of solid marble - a noble edifice which moves one to the depths of the soul. Its really exquisitely beautiful."
drewelowe,5545,,"Jan 6, 1928
Dearest Mother,
We just got in early this morning - it seems as though we always arrive at our various destinations upon a Sunday. Then the wold day is more or less spoiled by the time that we are settled for good. I don't know how we are going to like India. There was lots of color at the dock - men in brilliant red turbans and coats, beautiful orange colored scarfs and some blue sarongs (skirts). It was decidedly picturesque and lovely but this may not continue throughout all India. But we shall see. You may imagine that we were tickled to pieces this morning when the Am. Express man handed us a ""mittful"" of letters. It was a real Christmas treat and we enjoyed them one and all. In fact I don't know when I ever did enjoy anything half so much. And the list was almost complete - Mother, Fritz's, Andys, Ott.s, Esther's, and John's families, Ruth, George, Ann and Rob were all represented. Reiny and Irwin just sent a word. It was indeed worth the long ""dry spell"" and wait that we had endured. We hope that you are all very well."
drewelowe,5546,,"Esther didn't seem very well but I hope that she is better now. So much could happen and we wouldn't know about it. But we hope that nothing will and eventually we will have made the rounds and will be back home again. Our most tedious and biggest jumps are over now. Through India however, is 3000 miles and from Colombo to Port Said, Egype is an eleven day trip on the ocean, and after they are over Feb. 13 we shall travel with more ease. The distances in Europe are short and we shall be there for 6 months to enjoy a more restful period, I hope. We have had cooler weather now for two days and yesterday we got out our light coats (they had been put away since Nov. 17th) and had not been referred to since) The days will still be hot but the nights will be cool. I am so glad because we were absolutely sapped all the times in the tropics - every move was most fatiguing. I hope that Van will pick up a bit - he has had a most strenuous time on land and a miserable time on the sea. So he really never has a change to come back. He still is not a sailor and misses his meals regularly on the ocean. And now we have been 57 days on the sea somewhere or others. 
So Fritz stole a march on all of"
drewelowe,5547,,"3. us ""the old [Berm?]. But then we might have known that he would do a thing like that. I am going to spank him when I see him! We are all happy for him though and welcome the new sister just as heartily as though she had been nice and asked us to the weddin!
They family is steadily increasing. Just wait until Fritz steps forth with a twin upon each arm and a fatherly grin upon his face. This will be a most appropriate climax to the romance. Six of the family married now mother - don't give up hopes yet! Its lovely to have a big family - but never nicer than when you are on the other side of the world, lonely and forgotten; and then get a big armful of letters. Its more fun than a million. I wish that we might have several more Christmas's before next September which is a long, long way off. Our trip from Singapore to Calcutta was uneventful except for a day in Penang and two days in Rangoon, Burma. At Burma we visited a Mohammedan temple called the"
drewelowe,5548,,"""[Shewdagon?] Pagoda"". We had to take our shoes and stocking off and walk blocks up the most filthy steps. Along each side were shops -  but not such as your imagination paints, but only dirty squalled platforms with a few flowers or junk for sale. Much interest was lost because we were so busy watching ""our step"" that we hadn't the time to look about. Miserable ragged people slept along the way - lined along the stones. At the top was an immense area with thousands of niches with budda's, thousands of gold covered minerets (towers) all covered with intricate ""gingerbread"" carving Pillars done in design with colored glittering mirrors held up roofs before altars banked with flowers and in front of which were bowing and worshipping a steady stream of people. The natives bought flowers, gave their prayers than offered the flowers to the Buddas on the alter - but below on the floor was a litter of ashes, boxes, dirt and trash - inconceivable to the western mind. There was plenty of atmosphere and I enjoyed this event immensely - and miraculously enough our feet seem quite well. I suppose that we might have caugh anything hydrophobia, lepracy and what not, and perhaps we were foolish to go. I am glad however, that we did. All our love to your Mother. We think of your often and hope you are well. See you next September. Love and good wishes Van and Eve."
